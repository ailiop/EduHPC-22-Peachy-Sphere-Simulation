This subdirectory contains input files for simulations with different sizes,
i.e., numbers of interacting spheres.  Each file is titled with the size of the
corresponding simulation and contains parameter values for the initial
configuration of the spheres.

These input files are useful for visual inspection and debugging of the
simulation results.  Contrary to tiered inputs, the rendering resolution should
not increase with the simulation size, to facilitate visualization.
